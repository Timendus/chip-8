# Octo code

This directory contains some CHIP-8 code that I wrote in the
[Octo](https://johnearnest.github.io/Octo/) CHIP-8 dialect. Octo is a web based
IDE and interpreter in one, just like my own pet project in this repository, but
a lot more advanced.

The code in this directory is here in the hope it will be inspiring or useful to
someone. It is licensed under the GPLv3, just like the rest of the repository.
